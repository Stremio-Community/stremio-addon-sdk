# Stremio Addon SDK

A modern SDK for building [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) addons with TypeScript (or JavaScript).

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is in active development. Version `0.x.y` is usable but may introduce breaking changes between minor releases. The upcoming version `1.x.y` will mark the first stable release with semantic versioning guarantees.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ **Runtime validation** - Optional schema validation using Zod (or bring your own validation library)
- 🚀 **Modern** - ESM-first, tree-shakeable
- 🧩 **Modular** - Composable packages for different use cases
- 📦 **Multiple runtimes** - Supports Node.js, Node.js + Express, hono, vercel, cloudflare workers etc. (or bring your own runtime)
- 🔧 **Easy migration** - The API is similar to the official SDK making it easy to switch

## 📦 Installation

## 1. Install the SDK package

```bash
pnpm add @stremio-addon/sdk
```

## 2. Install a validation package (optional)

This step is optional but highly recommended to ensure your addon adheres to the expected schemas.

### zod

```bash
pnpm add @stremio-addon/validation-zod zod
```

## 3. Integrate with your preferred runtime (server, serverless, or custom)

See [supported runtimes](./docs/runtimes.md).

## 📖 Usage

See [examples](./examples/).

If you know how to code an addon using the official SDK, you pretty much already know how to use this SDK. You can migrate your existing code in ~ 2 minutes by following the [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).
