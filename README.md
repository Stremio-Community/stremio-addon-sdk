# Stremio Addon SDK

A modern SDK for building [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) addons with TypeScript (or JavaScript).

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ **Runtime validation** - Optional schema validation using Zod (or bring your own validation library)
- 🚀 **Modern** - ESM-first, tree-shakeable
- 🧩 **Modular** - Composable packages for different use cases
- 📦 **Multiple runtimes** - Supports Node.js, Node.js + Express, hono, vercel, cloudflare workers etc. (or bring your own runtime)
- 🔧 **Easy migration** - The API is similar to the official SDK making it easy to switch

## 📦 Installation

## 1. Install the SDK package

```bash
pnpm add @stremio-addon/sdk
```

## 2. Install a validation package (optional)

This step is optional but highly recommended to ensure your addon adheres to the expected schemas.

### zod

```bash
pnpm add @stremio-addon/validation-zod zod
```

## 3. Integrate with your preferred runtime (server, serverless, or custom)

See [supported runtimes](./docs/runtimes.md).

## 📖 Usage

See [examples](./examples/). If you know how to code an addon using the official SDK, you pretty much already know how to use this SDK. You can easily adapt to this SDK by following the [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).

- You prefer modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- You need runtime validation

**When to use the Official SDK:**

- You need proven stability with official support
- You're working with JavaScript
- You want the most battle-tested solution
